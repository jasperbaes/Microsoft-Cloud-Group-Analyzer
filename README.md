Entra Groups are often used in multiple locations in your environment and used by multiple admins. Without continuously updating documentation or syncing with other admins, you‚Äôre all using groups blindly, potentially causing unintended security or user impact through changes in group memberships. Therefore, I've created this script.

For **Microsoft Cloud admins** who **struggle to keep track of where Entra groups are used**, Group Analyzer is an **opensource script** that provides **instant insights in what services/policies/... a given group or user is scoped to**.

Group Analyzer is an essential script for Microsoft Cloud Administrators seeking comprehensive visibility into the usage of Entra groups across their environment. By providing detailed insights, this tool empowers admins to:

- **Prevent Unintended Impacts:** Safeguard against inadvertent membership modifications in groups that could trigger unexpected configuration changes in various services.
- **Enhance Group Management:** Maintain a clear overview of group assignments, ensuring efficient and informed management of your cloud environment.
- **Save time:** Don't spend time going over all of your policies and services looking where a certain Entra group is used.
- **Be in control:** To be certain and have confirmation that you are not adding users to groups, causing unforseen impact.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jasperbaes/Microsoft-Cloud-Group-Analyzer.git
cd ./Microsoft-Cloud-Group-Analyzer
npm install
```

Rename the .env.example file in the root of the folder to .env and fill in below fields (guide above):

```
CLIENTID=<app registration ID>
TENANTID=<your tenant ID>
CLIENTSECRET=<app secret>
```

## Usage

Examples:

```sh
node index.js <user ID>
node index.js <group ID>
node index.js all
```

Export examples:
```sh
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --export-json
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --export-csv
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --export-json --export-csv
```

Import example:
```sh
node index.js all -f Cloud-Analyzer-export.json
```

CLI-only, skip, limit and debug parameter:
```sh
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --export-json --cli-only
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --skip 10 --limit 5
node index.js xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx --debug
```

| Parameter           |               Description |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` | The group ID / user ID or 'all' should be the first parameter. This parameter is optional.  |
| `--export-json` | This parameter will export the results to JSON in a file in the current directory. This parameter is optional and can be used with any other parameter. |
| `--export-csv` | This parameter will export the results to JSON in a file in the current directory. This parameter is optional and can be used with any other parameter. |
| `-f` | This parameter specifies an import JSON file. Format needs to be the same as the JSON exported with the parameter --export-json. This parameter is optional and can be used with any other parameter. |
| `--cli-only` | With this parameter, the web report will not be generated or opened. This parameter is optional and can be used with any other parameter. |
| `-s` or `--skip` | Limits the number of groups in scope. |
| `-l` or `--limit` | Limits the number of groups in scope. |
| `-d` or `--debug` | Debug output and log file. |

Without specifying an ID in the command, the script will ask you to paste a group ID, a user ID or the word 'all':

| Option            |               example                |                                                     Description |
| ----------------- | :----------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Entra Group ID | `99ccbd7e-0fc9-4545-8cf9-ee89191ed78d` |                       The given group ID + subgroups will be in scope |
| Entra User ID  | `caf7b774-c8ab-47c3-a39e-d0a0d85d6423` | All groups where the given user is member of are in scope + subgroups |
| 'all'             |                 `all`                  |              This option will take all Entra groups in scope |

## Web report

Automatically, a visual web report will be generated and opened in your default browser. To save the report as a PDF file, use the shortcut Ctrl + P. To skip the web report and use the command line interface only, include the `--cli-only` parameter.
